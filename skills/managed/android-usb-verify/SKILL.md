# Android device verification (this Windows workstation)

Install, launch, drive and prove an Android app on a USB phone or emulator over adb.
Ironvellum (formerly Monarch, `D:\Monarch`) specifics are at the end.

## Toolchain

- SDK: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` (`platform-tools\adb.exe`, `emulator\`, `build-tools\36.0.0`,
  `platforms\android-37.0`); from git-bash, `"$LOCALAPPDATA/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe"`.
  Registry `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Android Studio` may have an empty SdkPath — don't trust it.
- JDK: the system Oracle 21 on PATH works; Android Studio's `jbr\bin\java.exe` is flaky from bash.
- Gradle: no gradle CLI is installed. Use the project wrapper from git-bash, `./gradlew.bat <task>`
  or `./gradlew <task>` (both verified 2026-09-24). **Never `cmd //c gradlew.bat`**: it exits 1 and
  prints nothing. A project without wrapper scripts runs
  `java -cp gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain <task> --console=plain`
  from the project dir (the SDK comes from its `local.properties`); fetch missing wrapper files from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/v<ver>/gradlew{,.bat}` + `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`.
- AGP 9.x has **built-in Kotlin**: applying `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` FAILS ("no longer
  required"). Remove it (root + app + catalog); keep `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` + KSP
  (≥2.3.1 for AGP 9). Kotlin DSL: drop `kotlin {}` compilerOptions unless needed.
- Version pins: read `maven-metadata.xml` from dl.google.com / repo1.maven.org for AGP
  (`com/android/tools/build/gradle`), Kotlin, Compose BOM, Room, Navigation, activity-compose,
  lifecycle. Pick the latest STABLE (skip alphas).
- Health Connect (`androidx.health.connect:connect-client` 1.1.0): the record class is
  `BodyFatRecord` (NOT BodyFatMassRecord); permissions in the manifest + rationale intent-filter;
  wrap reads in `runCatching`; gate the connect button on `HealthConnectClient.getSdkStatus`.

## Device choreography (every session)

1. `adb devices` — want `<serial>  device`. `unauthorized` means the RSA prompt is on the phone: the
   user must tap Allow (tick "Always allow"), then poll until it reads `device`. Missing entirely:
   replug. After `adb kill-server` / `start-server` the list can read empty for a moment — poll a
   few times before concluding the device is gone.
2. `adb shell svc power stayon usb` keeps the screen awake while plugged in; without it, screenshots
   come back as the lock screen or all black.
3. Before ANY screencap: `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_WAKEUP` + `adb shell wm dismiss-keyguard`.
   A black screenshot = screen off; a lock screen = re-run this step.
4. Install: `adb install -r app.apk`. A fresh state means `adb uninstall` first, which wipes the
   app's data (Room then reseeds cleanly) — never on a device that holds real user data.
5. Launch and check for crashes:
   ```
   adb logcat -c
   adb shell am start -W -n <package>/.MainActivity   # expect Status: ok
   adb logcat -d *:E AndroidRuntime:E | tail -20      # crash history: adb logcat -b crash -d
   ```
   Samsung system noise (minksocket, keystore2, BatteryDump) is normal; only `FATAL EXCEPTION` from
   your package matters. `am start -W` after `force-stop` is a COLD launch; a resumed task reopens on
   its last screen (the user may have navigated), so force-stop for a clean start.

## Driving Compose UIs headlessly

- Dump: `adb shell uiautomator dump /sdcard/ui.xml >/dev/null 2>&1; adb shell cat /sdcard/ui.xml > .tmp/ui.xml`
  (one-line XML).
- Extract tap targets by `text=` (or class) with sed — grep can't slice one-line XML, and some
  harnesses block shell grep:
  `sed 's/></>\n</g' .tmp/ui.xml | sed -n 's/.*text="NAME".*bounds="\[\([0-9]*\),\([0-9]*\)\]\[\([0-9]*\),\([0-9]*\)\]".*/\1 \2 \3 \4/p'`
  → tap the centre `((l+r)/2, (t+b)/2)` with `adb shell input tap X Y`.
- Checkboxes are `checkable="true"` nodes (unchecked = `checked="false"`); buttons are their
  `text=` bounds.
- Do NOT pipe sed output into `while read` — git-bash throws I/O error 87 mid-loop and silently
  skips taps. Write the bounds to a file first (`while read ... done < file`) or loop over
  whitespace-split tokens with a for-loop and a counter.
- Text entry: `input tap <field>`, `sleep 2`, THEN `input text "..."` (typing races focus);
  `input keyevent 111` (ESC) dismisses the IME between fields.
- Dumps often omit Compose field values and can be stale (check the byte size changes) — confirm
  state with a screenshot, not the dump.

## Screenshot proof

`adb exec-out screencap -p > .tmp/shots/<name>.png`, then read the PNG with a vision query (`?q=`)
asking for the specific labels and colours you expect. Trust only what the vision answer confirms.

## Editing and build pitfalls

- Editing source between a background Gradle run's start and finish gives stale or mixed builds —
  land ALL file writes first, then build.
- Edit-tool anchors on a file changed since the last read corrupt it. After any failed or
  mis-anchored edit, and on files edited more than once per session, prefer a full-file rewrite over
  another anchored patch.

## Ironvellum (formerly Monarch) specifics

- Repo `D:\Monarch`; package and applicationId `com.ironvellum.app` in both the `foss` and `play`
  flavours. Standing repo facts (flavour task names, the gate, backups, rename vocabulary) live in
  `monarch-session-context`.
- Devices: the owner's Samsung S25 Ultra `R5GL14GXV3J` (SM-S938B) holds **real training history**;
  the emulator is `emulator-5554` (AVD `IronvellumEmu`, boot it with `python tools/device.py up`).
  With both attached, pin every command with `adb -s <serial>` / `ANDROID_SERIAL`, and do anything
  destructive (uninstall, `pm clear`, instrumented suites) on the emulator. A deliberate reset of the
  phone goes through `monarch-fresh-account-reset`, after the backup in `monarch-session-context`.
- Build and install: `./gradlew.bat :app:installFossDebug`, or
  `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/foss/debug/app-foss-debug.apk`.
- Launch: `adb shell am start -W -n com.ironvellum.app/.MainActivity`; only `AndroidRuntime` FATAL
  lines from `com.ironvellum.app` matter.
- Build quirks: AGP 9.4 with built-in Kotlin, KSP 2.3.12. `SectionHeader` lives in
  `com.ironvellum.app.ui.components` (`Common.kt`) — a wrong-package import has bitten repeatedly.
