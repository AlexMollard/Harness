description: "Populate a dev/test environment with a real, size-bounded subset of a production asset repository — selecting complete units, importing into the target VCS with real authorship, and keeping the run resumable. Use when asked for \"real data in dev\", \"a test bed of real assets\", or \"some of the real repo, not the whole thing\"."
---

Materialise a bounded slice of a huge production repository as a working dev environment.

Assumes the layout survey already exists (see the `survey-remote-repo-layout` skill for
capturing a manifest without cloning). This skill covers what happens *after*: turning a
selection into a real, crawlable, committed bed.

## 1. Select whole units, never loose files

Pick complete assets/units, not files under a byte budget. A half-imported unit makes the
bed's derived data disagree with production, which defeats the point.

**Derive the selection from the real grouping logic, not a reimplementation.** If a
catalogue/index already ran over the full manifest, query *it* for unit → member-files.
That gives the production grouper's own output with zero duplicated rules, and lets you
assert the bed is a strict subset afterwards.

Budget with a **per-category cap**, not a flat total. Uncapped smallest-first lets one
heavy subtree eat the budget. Tune the cap to maximise unit count at the target size —
measured once: a 15 GB cap gave 956 units, a 10 GB cap gave 1,188 for the same 40 GB.

Commit the selection as a plain path list so the bed is reproducible.

## 2. Export resumably

- Pin the revision so bed and manifest describe the same tree.
- One export per file when the selection takes only part of some directories; whole-dir
  export pulls neighbours the budget excluded.
- **Resume by size, not existence.** A killed transfer leaves a short file; treating it as
  done imports a truncated binary and blames the exporter later.
- **Sweep the exporter's part-files before staging.** `svn export` writes `svn-<number>`
  beside its target and renames on success. A stray survives the resume check (it is not
  in the selection, so nothing accounts for it) and a filesystem-walking stage will commit
  it into the bed.

## 3. Import into the target VCS with real authorship

Commit **one commit per author**, grouped from the manifest. "Who touched this last",
collision detection, and people panels all read as a single name against a bed committed
by one identity.

Use a targets/response file — dozens of authors over thousands of files exceeds command
line limits.

### Traps that cost real time

- **`--repository <path>` says which repo; it does not define what a relative path means.**
  Relative paths resolve against the **working directory**. A targets file of
  repo-relative paths read from elsewhere matches nothing: stage exits 0 having staged
  nothing, and the failure surfaces one command later as commit's "Nothing staged" — a
  sentence about the wrong command. `Push-Location` into the workspace, in `try/finally`.
- **Never pipe a native command before reading its status.** `cmd | head; echo $?` reports
  `head`. Capture to a variable, then read the exit code immediately. This produced a
  false "exits 0" claim that contradicted observed behaviour.
- **Never swallow the tool's output.** Piping stage/commit to null yields "commit failed"
  with no reason — a script that must be edited before it can be debugged.

## 4. Make re-running safe end to end

Long imports get interrupted (a broker/server restart killed one 4 commits into 51, after
the full transfer). A script that answers that by refusing to start throws away the
transfer too.

- Detect an existing repository and carry on instead of failing to create one.
- Treat the tool's specific "nothing staged" text as **already committed**, not failure —
  otherwise a resumed run looks like N broken commits. Match the exact message only; every
  other failure text must still report. Verify by exercising several failure strings.
- Report `committed` and `already present` separately.
- Run the whole thing long-lived/detached; it will outlive the session.

## 5. Verify, and state what the bed cannot reproduce

- Crawl/index it and check unit and file counts match the selection exactly.
- Assert the bed's keys are a **strict subset** of the full survey's — read query output
  **line-wise**; splitting on whitespace silently breaks paths containing spaces and
  inflates counts.
- Workspace status with a forced rescan must be clean; unstaged leftovers show up here.

**Timestamps cannot be reproduced.** Most VCS stamp the commit with no backdating, so N
commits land in minutes: measured, 1,188 units sharing 49 distinct timestamps across
4m58s. Consequences to document *before* they look like bugs — "last touched by" reflects
import order rather than production history, and authors whose files are always
accompanied by a later-committed sibling never surface at all (48 names from 51 commits).

Faking dates means writing derived fields directly, which forfeits the property that makes
the bed trustworthy: a catalogue derived by crawling cannot disagree with the repository.
